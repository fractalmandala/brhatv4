title: The First 90 Days
---

The first 90 days are critical to any entrepreneurial endeavor, particularly creative ones working on culture. Here is a summary of our first 90 days.

On May 2nd, the auspicious occasion of Akshaya Tṛtīya and as per the guidance of our gurus, we announced our intent to come together as Bṛhat.

Intellectual clarity and moral conviction about the global relevance of our culture, trust in each other and support of our mentors were our seed capital.

Three weeks later, May 20th, we launched https://brhat.in/ – Bṛhat was born out of a vision to use the power of creativity in the service of civilization. To make our culture legible and relatable with the long-term goal of generating demand for culture-compatible public policy.

We were blessed with a tremendous show of support from multiple quarters right from our announcement. People reached out to offer their time, inputs, networks. Friends pitched in, helping us clear our framing and priorities. They even provided a space for us to work out of, without charge. This show of confidence and trust fuels us.

We resolved that as a team of creative professionals from diverse disciplines ranging from performing arts and medicine to cultural anthropology and education, we exist to:
- Create elevating literary and visual cultural content to foster ‘cultural belonging’.
- Curate curriculum, learning interventions and immersion possibilities for accessing our Knowledge Systems. Partner with academia to deliver IKS courses for civilizational leadership.
- Consult for creative mass media and other product/service enterprises that require cultural research input for brand authenticity and business strategy.

Like any good story, our journey has its own emotional graph. Many moments of exhilaration, awe and fun but also moments of frustration and apprehension.

The key challenge is to show how culture is the real basis for social cohesion, economic prosperity and national integrity. The outcomes in market place interventions and even social sector interventions are tangible – how do we clarify the value proposition when the product is ‘cultural thought’? Additionally, how do you seek and respect feedback without intellectual pretense and act on it with integrity?

We present our experience in 3 inter-related, mutually reinforcing dimensions:

1. The Functional – What did we produce, how was the performance, and what is coming up?
2. The Meta – What did we discover about our space, what are the enabling conditions, and what are the obstacles?
3. The Team – How are ‘we’ doing? Are we experiencing any self-transformation by working together – The Vyaṣṭi and the Samaṣṭi as we put out in our values.

#### The Functional
- 21 articles in our blog Dhīti focused on cultural representation in creative media, IKS education, ecology and linguistic building blocks of civilizational consciousness.
- 7 short videos as part of Bṛhadmṛdaṅga branding, covering universal emotions of hope, fear, oneness, and metaphors of Indian art and aesthetics.
- A design playbook – Ṛta in Design, for creative professionals to anchor their work in Dharma.
- 1 online course of ~18 hours – Introduction to Shri Ram Swarup (SRS).
- 1 field learning course – Bṛhat Anveṣī – Karnataka Temple-centric cultural immersion (registrations completed) and Batch 2 registrations are open.
- Launch of ‘Bṛhat Open Library’ – A curated learning repository that will be scaled into a full-fledged e-library.
- Partnering with AICTE and Ministry of Culture in organizing and executing the IKS Mela 2022 – Moderating 2 panels, rapporteur, media content and white papers (being prepared).
- Framing IKS curriculum outline – Political Philosophy, Leadership, Journalism. Brand Story Consultations.

#### The engagement this work yielded:
- ~12.8k+ followers across all channels | 17k unique visitors and 32k sessions on https://brhat.in/ .
- 158k views on videos translating to ~316k minutes of visual cultural content engagement.
- 165 participants in the Shri Ram Swarup course (We had to cap it, could have scaled to 200). This is now a very active community.
- Full cohort of 20 members for Bṛhat Anveṣī within a week of announcing the course – We have announced a second batch to accommodate the waitlist.

> “I like what @brhat_in is doing. Finally, something that is serious, accessible, & aesthetic in Hindu spaces. Kudos to the team.”

> “Day by day Brhat is growing exponentially. Love all your initiatives! Treat to all civilizational nationalists!!! Thank you so much @brhat_in”

Critically, the qualitative feedback has been very encouraging. People have been very generous with their praise of the design, aesthetics, content choices, depth and originality – some words from followers that warmed our hearts. We are building a steady community of ambassadors and establishing constructive feedback loops to bring that input back into our content and product roadmap. We are very grateful for this engagement and hold ourselves accountable to retain this trust. The goals we’ve set for ourselves for this calendar year are:

1. Activate multi channel engagement in the themes of Art, Literature, History, Economics and Ecology.
2. A coherent Indic design philosophy paradigm with a fully functional designer toolkit for creators.
3. Partner with universities to build IKS curriculum.
4. Indic models of Leadership Development for corporate partners.
5. Framework building and public communication of a culture based public policy analysis.

#### The Meta
The daily work builds our creative synapses but we also take time to reflect and build our contemplative abilities. Here are 4 big takeaways from our point of view.
1. There is a definitive civilizational moment – We have written about the architecture of this moment and the way to turn it into an enduring epoch here.
2. The civilizational movement needs a coherent ‘talent strategy’ – we are not going to win without this. It also requires a specific kind of leadership that can fuse creativity with values and that is in short supply. The vision at Bṛhat is to be the creative hub for our movement – writers, designers, product developers, artists, marketers etc.
3. Investor education is critical – Specific outcome-based (many a time, illusory) assessment models of the social and commercial ventures do not capture the cultural economy dimension. This requires an understanding of the network effects and the subliminal psychological dimensions of creative success and the compounding impact it has on all spheres.
4. There is a reticence to the idea of policy research – understandable given the gestation period of outcomes but building these sinews would be critical in the larger scheme and they take time and larger investments than content production.

#### The Team
Bṛhat is firstly and definitively a story of the people who came together to be a part of it. The founding team members who joined the call did not ask, ‘what is the career path at Bṛhat’, did not negotiate perks, they moved cities (and even countries) and disrupted their routines – this trust in each other and commitment is our core strength.

Despite that, we are keenly aware that it is one thing to feel good about each other and another to produce intense creative work as a team especially when the outcomes and even sustenance are uncertain.

As we hit the 90-day mark, the answer is very clear in our minds and hearts – conscientious and high-quality work will find its own support to scale.

Our focus over the past 3 months was on personal transformation in the service of a collective vision – it will continue to be so. The magic is in the alchemy.
We want to show that strategic creative work on cultural priorities is possible, sustainable and replicable. That there are no shortcuts in this journey.

Thank you for your trust. If you share our vision and wish to support or collaborate with us, write to us at contact@brhat.in. We promise to remain earnest.
