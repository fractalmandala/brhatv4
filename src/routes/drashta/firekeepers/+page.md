title: Firekeepers of Civilization
---

Hindu civilization today navigates a precarious turn. Great thought churning is going on for necessary changes in our society, culture and civilization. It is imperative at this crucial juncture to learn from the ancient as well as contemporary fire keepers of civilization – the great men of knowledge and wisdom, jñāna and sādhanā, who kept the flame of our civilization burning.

Civilization is an eternal yajña. And just as every yajña needs a yajamāna, the one who performs or protects dharma, so does the yajña of civilization. Agni, fire, is a symbol of civilization. It needs to be continuous for a civilization to be living. That is why at many places in Bhāratavarṣa, yajñās keep going incessantly.

This motif is all pervasive in Hindu cosmos. Just as the yajña fire needs to keep burning, so did the fire in the rasoi, the kitchen of every house, until it was replaced by LPG. The fire embers were kept in the night so that they could once again produce fire in the morning. Hindus, in this way, were literally, the fire keepers of civilization. It gives to us our name- we are Bharatas, the ones who bear or carry forward.

On an intellectual and civilizational level, this work is done by great rṣīs, scholars, thinkers and dārśanikas. By keeping the fire of knowledge eternally burning by continuous learning and teaching, through the great gurū-śiṣya paramparā, they kept the flame of Indic Knowledge Traditions burning.
